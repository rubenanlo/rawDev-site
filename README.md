# Features

This is a static website that includes the following features:

- [x] Form submission with email validation
- [x] Responsive design
- [x] Animations
- [ ] A dashboard with API calls to GitHub (upcoming)
- [ ] A centralized way to store all text (upcoming). Potentially creating a
      specific dashboard for admin to control all text from there.
- [ ] A dashboard for admin that will include: 1) RUD functionality for list of
      contacted people (recruiters and clients); 2) RUD functionality to change the
      text of the CV.
- [ ] Refactor de code to reduce repetitive code
- [ ] Make sure each component has a single responsibility (e.g., the
      `ContactForm` component should only be responsible for the form, not for
      the animation, the same goes for the others e.g., `AboutMe` component). To
      that end, I will have one single file with text for each component;
      another file with animations for each component
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Add google analytics
- [ ] Add SEO functionality
